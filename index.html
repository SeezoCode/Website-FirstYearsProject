                <p>The most important skill to learn in today’s world is to know how to write a computer program. Today,
                    computers have entered in almost every industry. Be it the autopilot in an aircraft or digital
                    speedometer in your bike, computers in various forms surround us. Computers are extremely useful for
                    an organization to scale up well. Gone are the days of pen and paper. Today, in order to store and
                    access your information, you absolutely need computers.</p>

                <p>The programming and developer communities are emerging at a rate faster than ever before. Various new
                    programming languages are coming up that are suited for different categories of developers
                    (beginners, intermediate, and experts) as well as for different use cases (web application, mobile
                    applications, game development, distributed system, etc). Every beginner is puzzled with the
                    question, "What programming language should I learn?" Let us take a look at best Programming
                    Languages to learn in 2020 for a job and for future prospects:</p>

                <h3 style="padding-top: 18px;">1. Python</h3>
                <p>Python undoubtedly tops the list. It is widely accepted as the best programming language to learn
                    first. Python is fast, easy-to-use, and easy-to-deploy programming language that is being widely
                    used to develop scalable web applications. YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, SurveyMonkey are all
                    built-in Python. Python provides excellent library support and has a large developer community. The
                    programming language provides a great starting point for beginners. Talking about those who are
                    looking for a better job, you should definitely learn Python ASAP! A lot of startups are using
                    Python as their primary backend stack and so, this opens up a huge opportunity for full-stack Python
                    developers.</p>

            <div class="col-md">
                <h3 style="padding-top: 18px;">2. JavaScript</h3>
                <p>JavaScript is the “frontend” programming language. JavaScript is widely used to design interactive
                    frontend applications. For instance, when you click on a button which opens up a popup, the logic is
                    implemented via JavaScript.</p>

                <p>These days, many organizations, particularly startups, are using NodeJS which is a JavaScript-based
                    run-time environment. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript for server-side scripting—running
                    scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web
                    browser. Hence now with JS, you can use a single programming language for server-side and
                    client-side scripts. If you are looking for that cool tech job at your favorite startup, you should
                    seriously consider learning JavaScript.</p>

                <h3 style="padding-top: 18px;">3. Java</h3>
                <p>Java is another popular choice in large organizations and it has remained so for decades. Java is
                    widely used for building enterprise-scale web applications. Java is known to be extremely stable and
                    so, many large enterprises have adopted it. If you are looking for a development based job at a
                    large organization, Java is the language that you should learn. Java is also widely used in Android
                    App Development. Almost any business today needs an Android Application owing to the fact that there
                    are billions of Android users today. This opens up a huge opportunity for Java developers given the
                    fact that Google has created an excellent Java-based Android development framework - Android Studio.

            <div class="col-md">
                <h3 style="padding-top: 18px;">4. C/C++</h3>
                <p>C/C++ is like the bread and butter of programming. Almost all low-level systems such as operating
                    systems, file systems, etc are written in C/C++. If you wish to be a system-level programmer, C/C++
                    is the language you should learn. C++ is also widely used by competitive programmers owing to the
                    fact that it is extremely fast and stable. C++ also provides something called STL - Standard
                    Template Library. STL is a pool of ready-to-use libraries for various data structures, arithmetic
                    operations, and algorithms. The library support and speed of the language make it a popular choice
                    in the High-frequency trading community as well.</p>

                <p>Swift is the programming language that is used to develop iOS applications. iOS-based devices are
                    becoming increasingly popular. Apple iPhone, for instance, has captured a significant market share
                    and is giving a tough competition to Android. Therefore, those who want to serve this community can
                    learn Swift programming.</p>
